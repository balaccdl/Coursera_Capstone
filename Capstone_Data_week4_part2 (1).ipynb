I will use the table \"London property value\" from the government website (https://data.london.gov.uk/download/average-house-prices/b1b0079e-698c-4c0b-b8c7-aa6189590ca4/land-registry-house-prices-borough.csv).\n\nThe table contains information about area code, name of the borough, the year, the measure (Mean, median, sales) and the Value. \nI will be focusing on mean Values from the year ending in December 2017.\n\n### Geographical and Venues Data\nI will get the geographical information of the borough using geolocator.geocode.\nI will then use foursquare to look at which boroughs have the highest number of restaurants and what are the top 5 trending venues. This will indicate the best borough where to open a luxury restaurant based on population, wealth, and trending venues.
